"""The Tomb of Nassak An-Rah -- a Vaults of Vaarn parser adventure.

A Zork / Action Castle homage set in the Blue Ruins of Vaarn. See the design spec
at docs/design/tomb-of-nassak-an-rah.md.

The game opens at the Caravan Wreck -- a safe onboarding room on the Tomblands
road that teaches the old-school verb+object language (EXAMINE / OPEN / TAKE /
LIGHT / DOUSE / READ / TALK) before the tomb can kill you (design doc §16.2).
The glowstone is found in the merchant's pack, not given. GO NORTH skips the
tutorial entirely.
