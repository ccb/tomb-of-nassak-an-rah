"""The Parser

The parser is the module that handles the natural language understanding in
the game. The players enter commands in text, and the parser interprets them
and performs the actions that the player intends.  This is the module with
the most potential for improvement using modern natural language processing.
The implementation that I have given below only uses simple keyword matching.

class LlmParser(Parser):
    """EXPERIMENTAL (untested against a live API). Intent *and* argument matching
    via an LLM, each constrained to the game's actual options.

    The second of the engine's two parsers. The default ``Parser`` handles
    verb-noun commands (ranking multi-word actions specific-first); ``LlmParser``
    handles flexible natural language ("hand the blacksmith my axe", "rouse the
    dragon") end to end: it overrides ``determine_intent`` AND the argument
    matchers (``get_character`` / ``match_item`` / ``get_direction``), since
    picking the right verb isn't enough -- "hand the blacksmith my axe" also needs
    "the blacksmith" resolved to the ``smith`` and "my axe" to the ``axe``.

    All four route through one primitive, :meth:`_pick_one`: the model chooses
    from an *enum* of the real options via structured outputs, so it can't
    hallucinate an action/character/item/exit that doesn't exist (a robust
    successor to the classic regex-over-a-numbered-list GPT parser). Options are
    described with their current location for disambiguation, and a ``hint``
    (e.g. "giver"/"recipient") is threaded through where the base API offers one.

    Graceful fallback: on any API error -- or when the model picks "none" -- each
    method defers to the deterministic ``Parser`` implementation, so a transient
    failure degrades to keyword matching rather than crashing the game. The
    deterministic parser covers canonical verb-noun input; the LLM covers the
    rest -- a natural hybrid.

    Cost note: a single command can trigger several LLM calls (intent + one per
    argument); spend is tracked by the usage ledger. ``anthropic`` is imported
    lazily, so importing this module adds no hard dependency. Requires the SDK +
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; the default model is ``claude-opus-4-8``.
