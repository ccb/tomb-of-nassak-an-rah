"""Crafting: combine ingredients into a new item (issue: reusable crafting).

A game declares **recipes** as data -- the way it declares locations and
triggers -- and one generic :class:`~text_adventure_games.actions.things.Craft`
action drives all of them. A recipe consumes a set of ingredients from the
crafter's held items, optionally requires one or more *tools* present but not
consumed (a cooking pot, a forge, a hammer -- station and instrument are the
same thing here), and produces one or more new items.

    game.add_recipe(Recipe(
        name="stew", aliases=["mushroom stew"],
        inputs=[Ingredient("water"), Ingredient("cave mushroom")],
        tools=[Ingredient("pot")],                       # required present, not consumed
        output=lambda g: Item("stew", "a bowl of mushroom stew"),
        result_text="You simmer the mushrooms in spring water into a stew.",
    ))

The player crafts with ``make`` / ``craft`` / ``cook`` / ``combine`` / ... :

    > make stew                 # by output name
    > combine string and stick  # by ingredients
    > cook                       # bare verb: the first recipe satisfiable here

Recipes hold a factory callable, so they are runtime-only (re-registered by
``build_game``, like triggers and behaviors) and not serialized.

INGREDIENT MATCHING. An ``Ingredient`` matches a held item by ``name`` OR by a
``tag`` (any item whose ``tag`` property is truthy -- e.g. ``tag="plank"`` for a
"any 2 planks" recipe). ``count`` consumes that many, summed over the matching
items' ``quantity``: a stackable named item (Item.make_stackable, #134) can
supply ``count > 1`` from a single stack ("2 sticks"), and tag matches sum
across distinct items.

KNOWN RECIPES (#135). By default a recipe is ``known`` (craftable from the
start), so existing games are unchanged. Set ``known=False`` to gate it on
discovery: the Craft action ignores it -- naming it reports "you don't know how
to make that", never the ingredient gap -- until the game calls
``Game.learn_recipe(name)`` (wired to a recipe book, an NPC, etc.).
